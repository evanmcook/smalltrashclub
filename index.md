## welcome to ♣️ small trash club ♣️

- small trash is simple novelty nonsense with a DIY spirit
- small trash is the act of doing projects even when the chips are down, when the chips are shortaged
- extra points if what you make has the illusion of being useful
- even more points if there is no illusion
- nobody is keeping score
